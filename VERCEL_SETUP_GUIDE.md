# üîß Complete Vercel Setup Guide

## üìã What You Need

You mentioned you have your Vercel token - great! Now we need to get the other two values and set everything up.

## Step 1: Get Your Vercel Organization ID and Project ID

### Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended - Easiest)

1. **Install Vercel CLI globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   - This will open your browser
   - Login with the same account you used to get the token

3. **Navigate to your project directory and link it:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/Vite-3d-Personal-Portfolio-Vercel
   vercel link
   ```
   
   You'll see prompts like:
   ```
   ? Set up and deploy "~/Vite-3d-Personal-Portfolio-Vercel"? [Y/n] y
   ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [Your Username/Organization]
   ? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
   ? What's your project's name? vite-3d-personal-portfolio-vercel
   ? In which directory is your code located? ./
   ```

4. **Get your IDs:**
   After linking, check the `.vercel/project.json` file:
   ```bash
   cat .vercel/project.json
   ```
   
   You'll see something like:
   ```json
   {
     "orgId": "team_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "projectId": "prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   }
   ```

### Option B: Manual Method (If CLI doesn't work)

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your Organization ID:**
   - Click on your profile/team name in the top-left
   - Go to "Settings" 
   - Look for "General" ‚Üí "Team ID" (this is your orgId)

3. **Find your Project ID:**
   - Go to your project in the dashboard
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Look for "General" ‚Üí "Project ID"

## Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   https://github.com/yusufdupsc1/Vite-3d-Personal-Portfolio-Vercel

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click "Settings" tab (top of repository)
   - Click "Secrets and variables" in left sidebar
   - Click "Actions"

3. **Add Repository Secrets:**
   Click "New repository secret" for each of these:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - Value: `[paste your vercel token here]`

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - Value: `[paste your org ID from step 1]`

   **Secret 3:**
   - Name: `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: `[paste your project ID from step 1]`

## Step 3: Test the Setup

1. **Go to your Pull Request:**
   https://github.com/yusufdupsc1/Vite-3d-Personal-Portfolio-Vercel/pull/1

2. **Check if CI is passing:**
   - Look for green checkmarks ‚úÖ
   - If there are red X marks, click to see what failed

3. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   - Once CI passes, click "Merge pull request"
   - This will trigger the deployment workflow

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

After merging:

1. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for "Deploy to Vercel" workflow
   - It should show as successful ‚úÖ

2. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Your project should show a new deployment
   - Click on it to see the live URL

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Vercel CLI doesn't work:
```bash
# Try logging out and back in
vercel logout
vercel login

# Or try with specific email
vercel login --email your-email@example.com
```

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're using the same Vercel account that owns the token
- Check that your token has the right permissions

### If GitHub Actions fail:
1. Check the error message in the Actions tab
2. Common issues:
   - Wrong secret names (must be exact: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`)
   - Invalid token or IDs
   - Vercel project not properly configured

## üì± Quick Reference

### Secret Names (Must be exact):
```
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID  
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
```

### Where to find values:
- **Token**: You already have this ‚úÖ
- **Org ID**: From `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link`
- **Project ID**: From `.vercel/project.json` after `vercel link`

### GitHub Secrets Location:
Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret

## üéØ What Happens After Setup

Once everything is configured:

1. **Every push to `main`** = Automatic deployment
2. **Every Pull Request** = Automatic testing
3. **Live website updates** = No manual work needed
4. **Security scanning** = Automatic vulnerability checks

Your modern 3D portfolio will be live and automatically updated! üöÄ
